# DSV
Discord Username's availability checker.



- Checks for a specific list of usernames.
- Generates and checks for a specific given amount of usernames with a specific username length, (e.g 4 letters usernames.)
- > #### This is a very early and LIMITED build you may face some bugs, unknown bugs. It may not work for you and work for some. It was written partly from scratch, barely tested, the code is messy. And again barely tested. But with your informing help, we can make it better. <a href="https://github.com/suegdu/DSV/issues/new">Open an issue here</a>.

# Notes
#### Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for/of any damage/results/returns/suspension made/resulted with/by this tool. It is your will to run, and once ran, it's your responsibility.

- Spamming Discord's API is against TOS, You may get your account suspended and I am not responsible. For a further caution, use an alt's token.
- You need to get your Discord's account's authorization token and paste it inside the variable: `TOKEN` . On how to do that check these following steps: https://www.androidauthority.com/get-discord-token-3149920/
- Your account must receive the <a href="https://discord.com/blog/usernames">name change update</a> to use this tool or else you may face some bugs or an invalid continuation of an `available` username.
- If you kept getting an `Available` username message despite it being taken, that means you have either reached the limit (***API***) or your account didn't receive the update.
- Make sure to have a decent delay or you may get your account disabled.
